									<h2>Used Car Price Prediction<br />
									using Machine Learning Models & Techniques.</h2>
									<p>In this data science project, I have conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about used cars. The dataset encompasses a variety of features such as the car's make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and various other factors that influence the pricing of used cars. The primary objective of this project is to gain valuable insights into the dataset through EDA and build a robust machine learning model to predict the price of used cars.</p>

                                        Exploring and analyzing the dataset is a critical phase that involves uncovering insights, understanding data distributions, and identifying potential patterns. Through visualization and statistical techniques, EDA aims to reveal the structure and characteristics of the data, aiding in feature selection and model development.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        Data preprocessing focuses on preparing the dataset for model training by addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Tasks include cleaning the data, handling null values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables to ensure a consistent and reliable input for machine learning algorithms.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p>Feature Engineering:<br />
                                        Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance the model's ability to capture meaningful patterns. This step requires domain knowledge and creativity, as engineers aim to extract relevant information and improve the model's predictive performance by providing it with more informative features.</p>

                                        <p>Model Selection:
                                        Model selection is the process of choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the characteristics of the data and the nature of the problem. Different algorithms have strengths and weaknesses, and the selection process involves identifying the most suitable model architecture for achieving the desired outcomes.</p>

                                        <p>Model Training:<br />
                                        Model training involves feeding the chosen algorithm with the prepared dataset to enable it to learn patterns and relationships. During this phase, the model adjusts its internal parameters iteratively to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes in the training data.</p>
