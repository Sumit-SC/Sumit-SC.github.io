  "short_description": "End-to-end ML pipeline: EDA, feature engineering, model selection, deployment.",
  "full_description": "Built a regression pipeline to predict used car prices using Python (pandas, scikit-learn). Applied feature engineering for age, drivetrain, fuel type, and mileage. Tuned tree-based models and evaluated with cross-validation, then exposed a simple prediction app for business users.",
  "problem_statement": "Estimate fair market value of used cars to improve resale pricing and reduce inventory holding costs.",
  "approach": "Data profiling and cleaning; feature engineering (age, brand segments); model benchmarking (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM); SHAP for explainability; Streamlit for inference UI.",
  "insights": "Feature importance showed mileage, age, and brand segment as the top drivers. Reduced mispricing risk and improved pricing consistency.",
  "tools": ["Python", "pandas", "scikit-learn", "XGBoost", "Streamlit"],
